# RainbowDAO 

## Multi-chain DAO Infrastructure Service Protocol




- ## Project Q&A




### 1、What is the RainbowDAO Protocol? 


RainbowDAO Protocol is developed under the authorization of the Rainbowcity  Foundation, focusing on the creation of web3 basic component. RainbowDAO Protocol belongs to a multi-chain infrastructure service protocol.  Anyone can create and manage their own DAO organization through RainbowDAO Protocol, including independent DAO,alliance DAO, parent DAO and child DAO. Any DAO can also create a management department within the DAO to achieve multi-level management of the organization.



### 2、What is the Rainbowcity Foundation？



Rainbowcity Foundation is a non-profit foundation initiated and founded by Mr. RainbowKun. Headquartered in Singapore, Asia, it mainly engages in the incubation and investment of the crypto ecosystem. Mr. RainbowKun himself is a loyal fan of Bitcoin and a believer of Satoshi Nakamoto, dedicated to the spread of Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralized ideas. He once put forward the concept of "Bit Civilization" for the first time in the world in July 2021 at the Bitcointalk Forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto , hoping to promote the development of the encryption industry worldwide and practice the true Bitcoin spirit.



Mr. Rainbow Kun believes that in the crypto world, human civilization will have an unprecedented super economy in the future. It is constructed in the form of a decentralized protocol, which puts different and decentralized economic behaviors into a unified economy, and truly becomes the infrastructure of future human civilization in the future. The Rainbow city Foundation was established under this background.

The Rainbowcity Foundation plans to invest in 7 major areas in the next ten years, including Rainbow DeFi, Rainbow Investment, Rainbow Culture, Rainbow Network, Rainbow Industry, Rainbow Education and Rainbow R&D. Strive to become a super economy with a market value of one trillion US dollars. The RainbowDAO Protocol is the first project launched by the Rainbowcity Foundation to build the infrastructure of the DAO ecosystem and contribute our wisdom and strength to the development of the global DAO career.



### 3、What are the social media of the RainbowDAO Protocol?

### 4、In which chains will the RainbowDAO Protocol be deployed in the future?



There are two versions of RainbowDAO Protocol, Solidity version on EVM and Ink! version on WASM.The Solidity version is mainly deployed on Ethereum, BSC, Poygon, Avalanche, Fantom, and various L2 networks; the Ink! version is mainly deployed on the parallel chains on the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains, as well as other blockchains developed with the substrate framework. 

In the future, we will participate in the parachain auctions of the Polkadot network and the Kusama network to create a parachain with DAO  infrastructure service as the core.

### 5.Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
